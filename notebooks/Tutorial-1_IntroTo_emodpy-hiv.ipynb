    "# Introduction to emodpy-hiv\n",
    "\n",
    "`emodpy-hiv` is the new way for configuring, running, and analyzing EMOD-HIV simulations.  It replaces the previous DtkTools / HIV-Analayzers / run_scenarios.py.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the goals of this new tool is simplify the configuration of EMOD by allowing the user to do it via Python instead of JSON.  This gives the user the benefits that include:\n",
    "- You don't have to worry about where parameters belong in deeply nested JSON.\n",
    "- Configuration errors can be detected in the python code before the simulations are created.\n",
    "- You can write a 'for-loop' when you only need to vary one value instead of copy and pasting large chunks of JSON.\n",
    "- A Python IDE can provide tool-tips or allow you to navigate into functions so that you can see the definition of the arguments/parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Packages of emodpy\n",
    "The emodpy “framework” consists of a collection of packages.   Each package provides a collection of features that pertain to an aspect of configuring and running EMOD.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **emod-api**\n",
    "   - Defines base-level objects and how the input files of EMOD are written (or read).\n",
    "- **emod-hiv** – (notice no “py”)\n",
    "   - Contains a schema and Eradication binary\n",
    "- **emodpy**\n",
    "   - The common set of EMOD configuration features used by disease specific versions.  The user should not need to know much about this package.\n",
    "- **emodpy-hiv/malaria**\n",
    "   - The disease specific packages should be the main package that users use for configuring EMOD for the disease they are working on.  These packages are a “subclass” of emodpy.\n",
    "- **idmtools**\n",
    "   - Provides a “low-level” workflow framework.  It provides an abstract way to run EMOD on different platforms and provides a workflow that involves suites, experiments, and simulations.  By itself, it is model agnostic.  (This would be similar to a model-agnostic DtkTools.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",

Hence, you need a binary before you can do anything, so to make this easy an emodpy-hiv package requirement is that you also get the emod-hiv binary package (notice no \"py\" after the \"emod\").  This package contains an executable and an associated schema file that you can use with this version of emodpy-hiv.\n",
